Hello. I'm Husayn Haras.

I find Software Development a hobby.
Still going through the learning process.
I like experimenting with Software.
I usually code in Rust and Python, and sometimes JavaScript and PHP.
I enjoy making my own Implementations of other Software.
I'm interested in Operating Systems, Networking and Web Development.
I do speak English, but not as well as Arabic.

Overall, I enjoy making Computers do stuff.
